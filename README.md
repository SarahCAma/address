`address.py` is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) app that has been built using the Python GUI framework – Tkinter. This app is connected to the SQLite database I created called `address_book.db`.  

Users are able to add new address records to the database, search for records stored on the database by the record’s unique identifier and delete records from the database.  

This app demonstrates my ability to create, manage and query databases via the **SQL** programming language. As well as my ability to use **Python** and **Tkinter** to make interacting with databases more user-friendly.
